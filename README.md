# CF-Instacart-Analysis-Project
__The Instacart Analysis Project uses real data made available by Instacart, along with manufactured customer data to provide a sandbox environment to demonstrate skills with Python to perform exploratory data analysis, statistical data analysis, and create visualizations to answer key business questions and identifiy insights to provide business intelligence guidance for hypothetical marketing use__

The project's purpose was to answer a set of Key Questions for theoretical marketing and sales teams at Instacart on customer profiles and behaviours that could inform targeting marketing to increase sales.

Jupuyter Notebooks were used to create the scripts to both analyse the data and create visualizations illustrating insights and marketing recommendations
