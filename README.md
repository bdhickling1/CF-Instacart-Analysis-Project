# CF-Instacart-Analysis-Project
__This data analysis project, prepared as part of the data analytics course for CareerFoundry, uses real product and sales data made available by Instacart, along with manufactured customer data to provide a sandbox environment to demonstrate skills with Python to perform exploratory data analysis, statistical data analysis, and create visualizations for BI.__

The project's purpose was to answer key business questions and identify insights for theoretical marketing and sales teams at Instacart on customer profiles and behaviours that could inform targeting marketing to increase sales.

Jupyter Notebooks were used to create the scripts to both analyse the data and create visualizations illustrating insights and marketing recommendations
